# Kubernetes-Deployment

This project provides a guide for deploying applications on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Kubernetes manifests.

## Getting Started

To get started with deploying applications on GKE, follow these steps:

1. **Create a VPC network**: Create a VPC network to host your resources. You can create a VPC network using the Google Cloud Console or the `gcloud` command-line tool. Make sure to configure the network settings according to your requirements.

2. **Create a GKE cluster**: Use the Google Cloud Console or the `gcloud` command-line tool to create a GKE cluster. Specify the desired cluster configuration, such as the number of nodes and machine type.

3. **Create Kubernetes Deployment manifests**: Write YAML files that define the desired state of your application deployments. Specify the container image, ports, environment variables, and other configuration options.

4. **Create Kubernetes Service manifests**: Write YAML files that define the services for your applications. Specify the target port, port mapping, and other service configuration options.

5. **Configure DNS**: Register a domain name with a DNS provider and configure the DNS settings to point your domain to the external IP address of the load balancer.

6. **Configure firewall rules**: Use the Google Cloud Console or the `gcloud` command-line tool to configure firewall rules. Allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports for HTTPS and SSH connections.

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't include details like persistent storage for MySQL, environment variables for WordPress and MySQL, or SSL/TLS configuration for HTTPS. You'll need to add those details based on your specific requirements.
